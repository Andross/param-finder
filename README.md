## Param-Finder

This Burp extension was created to help bug hunters brute force parameters on a website, specifically with James Kettles param finder. Default paramater lists are great for beginning your enumeration, but a more targeted list will bear much more fruit. This extensions goes through your Burp history, and creates wordlists from the parameters of every request for each target in scope. Work in progress...
